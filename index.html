    title: "Maid And The Rich Man",
    text: `In the bustling city of Jaipur, there lived a wealthy man named Raghav. He was known for his grand mansion, his luxurious cars, and his kind heart. Despite his riches, Raghav often felt a void in his life—a loneliness that even his wealth couldn’t fill.

One day, a young girl named Anjali came to his mansion, seeking work. She was poor, with torn clothes and tired eyes, but her spirit was bright, and she carried herself with dignity. Raghav hired her as a maid, noticing her sincerity and determination.

Anjali worked diligently, always with a smile. She would clean the mansion, tend to the garden, and even help the older staff with their tasks. Despite her struggles, she never complained. Raghav often observed her and admired her strength.

One winter evening, as Raghav walked into the kitchen, he found Anjali stitching a small, worn-out shawl under the dim light. Curious, he asked, "Why don’t you buy a new one?"

Anjali looked up and replied softly, "I save every rupee for my younger siblings. They depend on me."

Raghav was moved. Over time, he learned more about Anjali’s life—how she had lost her parents and took care of her younger brother and sister. Her resilience and compassion touched his heart.

Raghav began helping Anjali discreetly. He ensured her siblings received good education, gifted her warm clothes during winters, and even funded a small house for her family. But he never sought credit. For him, her happiness was enough.

One day, during a festive celebration at the mansion, Raghav realized he had fallen in love with Anjali. But he hesitated—would she accept him? Would society approve?

Gathering courage, he spoke to her. "Anjali, you are more than just a maid in this house. You are the most genuine, kind-hearted person I know. I want to spend my life with you."

Anjali was shocked. "But I am just a poor girl, sir. You deserve someone from your world."

Raghav smiled. "True wealth is not in money but in a pure heart, and you have the richest heart I’ve ever seen."

After much persuasion, Anjali agreed. Their marriage was celebrated by everyone in the city—a story of love that rose above status and wealth. Together, Raghav and Anjali started numerous charities to help the poor, ensuring no one had to face the struggles Anjali once did.

And so, they lived happily ever after, proving that love and kindness could bridge any gap.`,

    title: "The Lost Kite",
    text: "In a small village in Rajasthan, a boy named Aarav loved flying kites. Every evening, he would run to the big open field near the banyan tree, his colorful kite soaring high in the sky. His favorite kite was bright red with a golden border—his "lucky kite."  

One windy afternoon, Aarav's kite danced higher than ever before. He laughed as it twirled and swirled, challenging the other kites around. But suddenly, a strong gust of wind snapped the string. Aarav watched in shock as his kite floated away, disappearing behind the hills.  

Heartbroken, Aarav spent the next few days searching for his kite. He climbed trees, walked along streams, and even asked villagers if they had seen it. But there was no sign of the red kite.  

One day, while exploring a distant part of the village, Aarav saw a little girl sitting under a neem tree, holding a familiar red kite. Excited, he ran to her. "That’s my kite!" he exclaimed.  

The girl smiled shyly. "I found it stuck in the branches. It’s so beautiful, I couldn't let it go."  

Aarav hesitated, then said, "It is special to me. But… if you like it, you can keep it."  

The girl’s face lit up. She handed the kite back to Aarav. "No, it belongs to you. But maybe we can fly it together?"  

From that day on, Aarav and the girl, Meera, became best friends. The red kite flew higher than ever, carrying with it the joy of their newfound friendship.  ",
